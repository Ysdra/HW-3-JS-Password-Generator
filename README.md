# HW-3-JS-Password-Generator
A random password generator that utilizes JavaScript. 

## Purpose & Requirements
A random password generator that demonstrates through the power of JavaScript how we can generate random elements to create the desired result. The thought process is to design a random password generator that generates a password with a length between 8-128 characters long that includes special characters as well.


## Thought Process

I began by defining some constants and special characters out of a small selection of special characters. I then made some functions to clean up the code by replacing them over the original loops I had in the main javascript.
